<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since 2021, variants of the virus have emerged or become dominant in many countries, with the Delta, Alpha and Beta variants being the most virulent. As of 1 September 2021, more than 217 million cases and 4.51 million deaths have been confirmed, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.</p>
<p>Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one’s mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines have been distributed in many countries since December 2020.</p>
<p>The virus was confirmed to have reached Mexico in February 2020. However, the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) reported two cases of COVID-19 in mid-January 2020 in the states of Nayarit and Tabasco, with one case per state.</p>

<p>This table includes the date, new cases, new death people and new tests people by month since January 2020 to August 2021.It can search by month or year as wanted in the table’ which is really convenient for reading the table.</p>
<p>The vacancy in the number of new deaths in January and February 2020 implies that there were not many deaths caused by the COVID virus, but this may be because the COVID cases only appeared and grew rapidly at the end of February. In contrast, new cases fluctuated greatly from March to September 2020. new cases and deaths decreased to a low point in October 2020 but continued to fluctuate again in November. The number of deaths fluctuated downward until March 2021, but the number of new cases still fluctuated significantly until the latest.</p>

<p>The Figure<a href="#fig:totaldeath">1</a> represents the dynamics of the number of confirmed COVID diagnoses and the number of deaths due to New Coronavirus in Mexico from January 1, 2020 to August 28, 2021. By looking at the data in the above graph, one wonders what is the death rate of the New Coronavirus epidemic in Mexico?</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

Figure 2: The Trend of Daily Case Number

</div>
</div>
<p>Since the mortality rate of the new coronavirus outbreak in Mexico is much higher than the world average, I wonder about the number of new deaths it has added each day, and according to the Figure<a href="#fig:daily">2</a>, we can tell that the number of deaths on the days 2020-10-05, 2021-02-05, 2021-04-10, and 2021-06-01 are much higher than the number of deaths in the time period they are in.</p>

Figure 3: The Percentage Trend of People Get Test for COVID
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Is the number of confirmed cases due to changes in the number of tests? According to the Figure<a href="#fig:test">3</a>, the percentage of tests has been increasing steadily without any significant fluctuations, so the sudden increase in the number of confirmed cases on a particular day should not be related to the number of tests.</p>
<p>At the same time, the new crown epidemic is highly transmissible and spreading rapidly, and by August 28, 2021, the percentage of tests in Mexico had not yet reached seven percent, a relatively small percentage even compared to some developing countries.</p>

Figure 4: The Rate Trend of People Get Test Positive for COVID
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Excluding the number of tests that led to a sharp increase in the number of confirmations on individual dates, we see from the Figure<a href="#fig:postitive">4</a> that the percentage of positive tests has a large fluctuation, with the percentage of positive tests reaching a peak around July 2020 until May 26, 2021, when it dropped to 0.156, followed by a wave of increases until the latest data showed a small decrease.</p>
